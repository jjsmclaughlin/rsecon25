32. John Joyner, was indicted for stealing fifty two Hundred and twenty five Pound of Logwood, value 26 l. the Goods of Samuel Sidebotham and Thomas Wright, in the House of John Farmer, March 16. And 33. Thomas Stedman, of St. Leonard Bromley, for receiving two Hundred Weight of the same knowing it to be stol'n, March 16. And. 34. Matth.ew Bedford, of White Chapple, for receiving fifty Hundred Weight of the same knowing it to be stol'n, March 17. It appear'd that a large Quantity of Logwood belonging to Mess. Sidebotham and Wright, was lost out of the Ware House of Mr. Farmer. That the Prisoner Joyner, who was a Ballast-man, lodged at the Prisoner Stedman's House, the Hand in Hand at Bow Creek. That a remarkable Boat (both ends being alike) loaded with Logwood was seen at Stedman's Back Door on the sixteenth of March. That Joyner own'd he put the Logwood into the Boat: And that Joyner's Mate ( Richard Bogue ) had carried the Boat into Bow Creek. That three Cart Loads of Logwood were carried from Stedman's (by order of Joyner and Bogue) to the Prisoner Bedford's House, at the Grey-hound against White Chappel Church on the seventeenth of March, besides one Load from the bottom of Old Gravel Lane, and one Load from the Hermitage. And that two Hundred Weight of Logwood was afterwards found, part in Stedman's Brew-house, and Part in his Stable. But there not being sufficient Proof that this Logwood was the same that was lost, or that Joyner stole it, the Jury acquitted the Prisoners. John Joyner, was a second time indicted. And. 35. Thomas Easton, for breaking and entring the House of John Farmer, and stealing fifteen Hundred and twenty five Pound of Logwood, the Property of Samuel Sidebotham, and Thomas Wright, April 27. about the Hour of one in the Night. John Farmer I live at Lime Kiln Dock. My Warehouse and Dwelling House are Contigous; they are not both under one Roof, but the Roofs join, and there is a Door goes out of my Dwelling House into the Warehouse, in which I had a considerable Parcel of Logwood belonging to Samuel Sidebotham, and Thomas Wright. Between one and two on Sunday Morning, the twenty seventh of April, the Watch called me up, and said, my House was broke open. I went into my Yard, and saw a Man standing there, but as soon as he perceiv'd the Light of the Lanthorn, he stept into a Ballast Lighter that was moor'd under the Crane. I found fifty two Sticks of Logwood lying in the Yard close to the Water Side. The two Prisoners were both found in the Lighter, and pretended they were driven thither by Stress of Weather, tho' there was no Wind stiring. They had left their Key in the Warehouse Door. Before the Justice they denied that they were in the Yard; yet Joyner own'd that Key, and they both confest that they moor'd the Lighter there. Daniel Lewis. About one in the Morning, it being just High Water, my Boat got a Shore by this Gentleman's Yard, and had like to have been over set. I saw this Ballast Lighter coming up with two Men in her, and suspected they had no good Design, and so I lay down in my Boat to watch them. Presently they moor'd the Lighter under the Crane and both came ashore, and whispered. Then they went towards the Warehouse, and I heard the Door open. I saw them bring out Logwood, and lay it by the Water Side. I believe they went seven or eight times in the same manner. It was a Moon-light Night, and tho' I could not then distinguish their Faces because I was on the other Side of the Dock, yet I can swear that the Men that came out of the Lighter, were the same Men that opened the Warehouse Door, and brought out the Woods, for I could see very plainly that there was no other Person in the Yard; and they and no others were taken in the Lighter. I went and call'd the Watch, and then the Prisoners jump'd off the Wharf into the Lighter, where they were both taken. Easton. Was there no other Lighter? Lewis. Yes; there was a Chalk Lighter. John Jones. I was just come from Eriff, and went to the Watch House, when Lewis came and told us the Ware House was broke open. We went in my Boat, and I heard the Logwood rattle; but as soon as the Light came, I saw the Prisoners jump off the Wharf into the Lighter. Joyner crept under the Foresail, and Easton laid down on the Windless, both pretending to be asleep. I pulled the Foresail off Joyner, and he asked hastily what's the matter? what's the matter? - When they were before the Justice, Joyner own'd that the Key which was found in the Ware House Door, was the Key as locked his Oars. Joyner. We had no Oars at that time. Jones. May be so - But you said so for all that. J. Swainson. There were fifty two Pieces of Logwood, and one piece of Redwood, taken out of the Ware House, and left at the Edge of the Wharf. The Logwood weigh'd fifteen Hundred, one Quarter, and twenty one Pound, and was worth ten Shillings a Hundred. Thomas Williams, a Lighter Man (Easton's Godfather,) John Mires of Lime House (with whom Easton lodged,) William Martin, Thomas Pardo, William Atkinson, Richard Caves and Thomas Young, deposed, that Easton was a hard working Man, and they knew no ill of him: But they added, they could say nothing in favour of Joyner. The Jury found them both Guilty of Felony only. John Joyner, was a third time indicted for stealing thirty Barrels of Tar, the Goods of Josiah Jetsom, April 17. But he being convicted on the former Indictments, the Court thought it unnecessary to try him on this. [Transportation. See summary.]
